# Hybrid Causal-XAI Framework for Network Intrusion Detection Systems

A novel framework combining causal inference with explainable AI to improve the actionability, trustworthiness, and diagnostic utility of deep learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).

## Project Overview
Modern NIDS based on deep learning achieve high accuracy but suffer from two critical flaws:

- **Opacity:** Black-box models that analysts cannot trust or understand  
- **Correlation vs. Causation:** They identify patterns but not root causes, leading to alert fatigue

This project addresses these issues through a hybrid framework that:

- Uses causal discovery to identify root causes of attacks  
- Applies XAI techniques to explain model predictions  
- Combines both to generate actionable, trustworthy explanations for security analysts  

---

## Research Question
Can a hybrid framework that combines causal inference for root cause analysis with post-hoc XAI for alert justification significantly improve the actionability, trustworthiness, and diagnostic utility of an AI-based NIDS?

---

## Methodology
### Step 1: Baseline NIDS Model
We adopt a deep learning–based NIDS model architecture similar to the one used by Kalakoti et al. in “Evaluating Explainable AI for Deep Learning-Based NIDS Alert Classification” [1] (Link to paper [here](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2025/131807/131807.pdf))
- **Model:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network  
- **Task:** Binary classification (benign vs. malicious traffic)  
- **Dataset:** TalTech NIDS alerts (1.4M samples, 42 features)  
- **Performance:** 99.5% accuracy on test set  

### Step 2: Causal Discovery
- **Algorithms:** PC (constraint-based) and GES (score-based)  
- **Features:** 10 network features (5 SOC-expert + 5 XAI-derived)  
- **Output:** Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) showing causal relationships  
- **Domain Knowledge:** Applied 11 forbidden edges based on network security constraints  

### Step 3: XAI Integration
- **Methods:** SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT  
- **Evaluation:** Faithfulness, complexity, robustness, reliability  
- **Best Performer:** DeepLIFT (highest faithfulness and reliability)  

### Step 4: Hybrid Explanation Generation
Combines XAI feature importance with causal pathways  
**Format:** "Alert flagged because [XAI], root cause is [Causal]"  

### Step 5: Evaluation
- **Quantitative:** Faithfulness and robustness metrics  
- **Qualitative:** User study with security analysts

## Key Results
### XAI Evaluation (Step 1)
| Method | Faithfulness | Monotonicity | Max Sensitivity | Complexity | RMA | RRA |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|------|------|
| LIME | 0.42 ± 0.18 | 59.6% | 0.36 ± 0.12 | 3.03 ± 0.07 | 0.62 | 0.53 |
| SHAP | 0.40 ± 0.29 | 64.5% | 0.02 ± 0.09 | 2.47 ± 0.21 | 0.65 | 0.47 |
| IG | 0.18 ± 0.38 | 73.7% | 0.18 ± 0.25 | 2.17 ± 0.41 | 0.59 | 0.34 |
| DeepLIFT | 0.76 ± 0.27 | 78.4% | 0.00 ± 0.00 | 2.26 ± 0.33 | 0.78 | 0.68 |

**Winner:** DeepLIFT outperforms on all metrics.

### **Causal Discovery (Step 2\)**

* **PC Algorithm**: Discovered 42 directed edges  
* **GES Algorithm**: Discovered 29 directed edges  
* **Consensus**: 20 edges agreed by both algorithms  
* **Root Causes**: Proto, ExtPort (features with no incoming edges)  
* **Direct Causes of Alerts**: SCAS, SignatureIDSimilarity, Similarity, SignatureMatchesPerDay, IntPort, AlertCount, ProtoSimilarity

**Key Causal Pathways:**
```bash
SignatureMatchesPerDay → SignatureIDSimilarity → SCAS → Label  
Proto → SignatureIDSimilarity → SCAS → Label

IntPort → Label (direct cause)
```

### **Hybrid Explanations (Step 4\)**

Successfully implemented hybrid explainer combining XAI \+ Causal analysis.

**Example Output:**

* Prediction: Important (95% confidence)  
* XAI Top Feature: SCAS (importance: 0.42)  
* Root Cause: SignatureMatchesPerDay (5000/day)  
* Causal Chain: SignatureMatchesPerDay → SignatureIDSimilarity → SCAS  
* Recommendation: Block IP, investigate correlated hosts

## **Limitations**

1. **Causal Discovery Assumptions:**  
   * Assumes causal sufficiency (no hidden confounders)  
   * Uses observational data (not from controlled experiments)  
   * Relies on conditional independence tests  
2. **Dataset Constraints:**  
   * Single organization (TalTech)  
   * 60-day collection period  
   * Imbalanced classes (1.5% important alerts)  
3. **Computational Requirements:**  
   * Causal algorithms are computationally expensive (O(n³) for PC)  
   * XAI methods require model re-evaluation for each sample  
4. **Generalization:**  
   * Results specific to Suricata NIDS  
   * May not transfer to other NIDS platforms or network environments
